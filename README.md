# Factory Pattern Exercise

We have a program that logs to the console every 10 secounds. The program works, but we do have a problem. Loggers.cs do way to much,
and we create 3 different loggers in our code.

Create a factory and make the code clean and DRY!

Check after examples online and try yourself, if you get stuck and don't get it. Check the original youtube video below.
